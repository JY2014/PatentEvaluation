        <h1><b>Increase Return of Patent Investments</b></h1>
        <br>
        <h4 style="text-indent: 40px">The web app is developed to predict potential usefulness of patents 
        based on patent information and content, aiming to increase the overall 
        return of patent investment for companies. <h4>
        <h4 style="text-indent: 40px">Patents serve as an important asset for technology companies. Big technology 
        companies may apply for thousands of patents in a single year 
        <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/01/09/most-patents-2016/" class="text">[1]</a>. 
        However, 
        reports estimated that most patents failed to generate enough return to cover 
        the investment <a href="http://ei.com/wp-content/uploads/downloadables/EI_Patent_Study_Singer.pdf" class="text">[2]</a>. 
        Evaluating the potential of a patent based on its content 
        is a difficult task even for experts. However, machine learning methods 
        are able to help on this task by processing complex information and picking 
        up subtle signals. This web app is estimated to generate about $2000 increased 
        net value per applied patent, if only innovations that are predicted as 
        “useful” are patented.    
        </h4> 
        
        <br>
        
        <h2><b>Using the Web App</b></h2>
        <h4 style="text-indent: 40px">The <a href="jennyyu.tech/patent" class="text">web app</a> 
        takes patent number as an input, and automatically 
        scrapes the patent information from 
        <a href="https://patents.google.com/" class="text">Google Patents</a>. 
        Information of a patent 
        that has not been published can be manually entered 
        <a href="jennyyu.tech/manual_input" class="text">here</a>. The app can also 
        randomly pick a patent from a subset published in 2011 for demonstration purposes. 
        As a result, the app will generate the likelihood and recommendation on whether 
        a patent will be “useful”. </h4>

        <h4 style="text-indent: 40px">The usefulness of a patent is determined by the duration that the owner 
        maintained the patent. Although each patent may have about 20 years maximum 
        lifetime, the owners need to renew the patent three times in year 4, 8 and 12.
        Based on the time needed to commercialize a patent, the patents that the owner stopped 
        renewing at/before year 8 are considered to be “not useful”, while the patents 
        with lifetime longer than 8 years are considered to be “useful”. </h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <h2><b>The Training Data</b></h2>
        <h4 style="text-indent: 40px">University patents approved by US patent office were scraped from 
        <a href="https://patents.google.com/" class="text">Google Patents</a>. 
        The classifier was trained on 10,030 patents in 2004-2007. Features used include 
        basic information of the patent, <i>e.g.</i> classification and numbers of applications, 
        and the content of the patent claims. In addition, a Word2Vec model was trained on 21,000 university patents in 
        2004-2010 to process the text data.</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <h2><b>Models</b></h2>
        <h3><i>Word2Vec Model</i></h3>
        <h4 style="text-indent: 40px">A Word2Vec model was trained on the claims of 21,000 patents. The model was 
        used to process each word in the claims of the training patents. The average 
        vector of each patent serves as features in the random forest classifier. </h4>

        <h3><i>Random Forest classifier</i></h3>
        <h4 style="text-indent: 40px">Both the text features and non-text information were fed into a random 
        forest model. Hyperparameters were tuned by 5-fold cross validation. The final 
        model was selected based on a self-define metric described below. </h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <h2><b>The Metric</b></h2>
        <h4 style="text-indent: 40px">Models were selected by net value of investment during cross validation. 
        The net value was calculated based on the model prediction, and estimated cost 
        and value of patents. Here are the assumptions made for the calculation:</h4>
        <h4 style="margin-left: 40px">1.	Only patents predicted to be useful will be applied;
        <br>2.	Only patents that are actually useful will generate value;
        <br>3.	Cost of preparing and applying for a patent is $20,000 
        <a href="http://www.insidecounsel.com/2016/09/16/whats-a-patent-worth" class="text">[3]</a>;
        <br>4.	Value of a “useful” patent is estimated to be around $30,000 
        <a href="http://www.tynax.com/transactions_patent_sale_guide.php#5-Valuation" class="text">[4]</a>.</h4>
                                                                            
        <br>
        <h2><b>Results</b></h2>        
        <h3><i>Feature importance</i></h3>
        
        <h4 style="text-indent: 40px">The final model heavily relies on the text features to classify
        the patents, suggesting that patent claims contain essential information related to 
        patent "usefulness". Moreover, some non-text features such as the number of applications 
        and usage claims also play important roles. The result also suggests that 
        the field of application (classification) and number of authors of the patent have little effect
        on the classification.

    <h3><i>Model performance</i></h3>
    <h4 style="text-indent: 40px">On the 2000 patent from 2004-2007 in the held-out testing data, 
    investment based on the model prediction is estimated to generate $2.79M increased net value 
    compared to the baseline situation of applying for all the patents. The average 
    return per applied patent is estimate to be increased by $2064 by the model. </h4>
